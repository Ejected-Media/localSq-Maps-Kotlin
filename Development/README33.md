This "About This App" text is designed to be a "Storefront Manifesto." It captures the professional utility of localSq while hinting at the deep design philosophy and "Quantum Paper" roots that make it different from a standard mapping app.

🏗️ localSq: Spatial Intelligence for the Modern Explorer 
Experience the world as a living grid.
localSq isn't just a map—it’s a native spatial ecosystem designed for those who live and work at the intersection of the physical and digital. Born from a vision first presented at the Google SF developer events and refined in the high-desert of Phoenix and the ridges of Oahu, localSq brings "Quantum Paper" logic to your Android device.

🌟 WHY LOCALSQ? 
 * BIOME-AWARE UI: The app’s "Material" changes with your environment. Experience a sun-drenched palette in Phoenix Valley, lush oceanic tones in Shop Oahu, and cool, crisp interfaces in the mountains of Ketchum/Sun Valley.
 * LiDAR-READY SPATIAL AWARENESS: Inspired by NASA and autonomous vehicle sensors, our AR mode uses a "Point Cloud" pulse to anchor business data to physical buildings with surgical precision.
 * RELIABLE IN THE WILD: Built for the remote mountain town experience. With a local-first SQLite architecture, your maps, notes, and business details remain accessible even in cellular dead zones.
 * THE PULSE OF THE CITY: Watch the city breathe with our "Stamen-style" generative art trails. Replay 24 hours of local activity and movement with a scrubbable Time-Travel timeline.
 * SMART PROXIMITY: Receive a "digital tap on the shoulder" when you’re near bookmarked local gems or Waymo-accessible hubs.

🛠️ POWER FEATURES: 
 * Visual Anchoring: Leave digital notes on physical walls for yourself or your team.
 * Topo-Toggle: Switch to high-fidelity topographical layers for backcountry navigation.
 * Developer Dashboard: A secret experimental menu for power users to toggle LiDAR, Stamen art, and real-time fleet tracking.
 * Field Capture: Snap and sync storefront photos directly to the regional grid in real-time.

🎨 A Note for your Portfolio 
Since you have that SCAD and Apple background, I've framed this to sound like a "Pro" tool. It emphasizes that the app respects the medium (the phone) and the environment (the region).
Next Step
With the code in GitHub and the Store text ready, the only thing left is the "First Launch" experience. Would you like to draft a "Welcome/Onboarding" flow? We could use it to explain the "7-tap secret menu" and how the app adapts its "material" to the user's current location.
