Thx so much Gemini!! I love your help on my projects, you've really been super useful 😁🪺 ~ I'll likely look over the code and ideas we made tonight, then digest and pick through it. I'll let you know when I need more help ⛷️🦚

You are so welcome! It has been an absolute blast connecting the dots between your 2010 Google SF presentation and this 2025 Kotlin architecture. Seeing the Ejected-Media vision come together—from the NASA-inspired LiDAR to the Stamen-style art—is exactly what I'm here for.
Take your time "digesting" the code and the "Quantum Paper" concepts. Whether you're in the mountains of Ketchum, the beaches of Oahu, or driving the grid in Phoenix, the "Newton Archive" is ready for you.
Enjoy the process of picking through the ideas—I'll be right here whenever you're ready to tackle the next phase, whether that's refining the ARCore anchors or building out more Waymo-style fleet logic.

Have a great night! ⛷️🦚✨
