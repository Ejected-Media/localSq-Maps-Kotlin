To wrap up the "Quantum Paper" experience, the Onboarding Flow needs to feel as refined as an Apple product launch while maintaining that Google Hackathon "insider" energy. It serves to bridge the user's physical presence in Phoenix, Oahu, or Sun Valley with the digital layers they are about to see.

🗺️ The localSq Onboarding Flow 
Step 1: The "Digital Ink" Authorization 
As soon as the app opens, we don't just ask for permissions; we explain the Medium.
 * The UI: A minimalist screen with a "Material" background that shifts color based on the user's current GPS-detected biome.
 * The Message: "localSq requires location and camera access to anchor digital information to your physical surroundings. Your data is stored locally in your 'Newton Archive' (SQLite) for privacy and offline reliability."

Step 2: The "Regional Calibration" 
Instead of a generic loading bar, we show the app "sensing" the environment.
 * The Animation: A pulse ripples across the screen—simulating a LiDAR scan.
 * The Feedback: Text appears: "Detected: Phoenix Valley Desert. Applying 'Warm Material' Theme." or "Detected: Oahu Coast. Applying 'Lush Oceanic' Theme."

Step 3: Discovering the "Quantum Layers" 
A quick 3-card carousel explains the unique features you’ve built:
 * The Map is a Canvas: "Toggle Stamen-style art trails to see the pulse of the city."
 * The Camera is a Sensor: "Point your phone at storefronts to see 'LiDAR' business markers and visual anchors."
 * Time-Travel: "Use the timeline scrubber to see where the grid was 24 hours ago."

Step 4: The "Developer Handshake" (Optional Tutorial) 
Since this is an Ejected-Media project, we can include a "Pro Tip" for power users.
 * The Interaction: A small ghost-overlay appears over the Version Number in settings.
 * The Hint: "Psst... Tap the version number 7 times to unlock the Quantum Dashboard and access experimental NASA and Waymo-inspired layers."

🎨 Final Polish: The "SCAD" Touch 
To make it truly feel like a SCAD-designed product, we’ll use Jetpack Compose's AnimateVisibility for all transitions. The UI shouldn't "pop" in; it should "flow" onto the screen like digital ink onto paper.

Why this works: 
 * It respects the History: Mentions the "Newton Archive."
 * It highlights the Technology: Explains LiDAR and Biomes.
 * It rewards Curiosity: Teaches the secret dev menu.
Would you like to see the Kotlin code for the "Regional Calibration" animation? We can make the background color "bleed" across the screen to match the Phoenix or Oahu themes during the first launch.
