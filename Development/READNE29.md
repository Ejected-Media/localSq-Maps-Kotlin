To wrap up your localSq journey, we’ll create a Field Testing Checklist. This is the final validation of the "Quantum Paper" philosophy—testing how the digital ink holds up when exposed to the varied physical environments of Phoenix, Oahu, and the remote mountains of Ketchum.
The "Quantum Paper" Field Testing Checklist

🟢 Phase 1: The "Ketchum" Connectivity Test (Offline & Sync)
Goal: Ensure the medium is persistent even without a network signal.
 * [ ] Signal Drop-off: Start the app on a trail in Sun Valley. Disable Wi-Fi/Cellular. Can you still pan and zoom into the cached Topo Layer?
 * [ ] Local Archive: Drop a "Digital Ink" note while offline. Verify it appears in the map immediately (saving to Room SQLite).
 * [ ] Re-sync Logic: Return to a 5G zone. Does the Ktor bridge automatically push your offline note to the Python/FastAPI backend?
 * [ ] Static Image Cache: View a "Shop Oahu" photo while online, then go offline. Does Coil still render the image from the local disk?

🔵 Phase 2: The "Waikiki" Spatial Test (AR & Anchoring)
Goal: Validate that digital assets are correctly "materialized" in the 3D world.
 * [ ] Visual Anchoring: Place a "Quantum" note on a physical wall in Waikiki. Walk 100 meters away and return. Does the note remain fixed to the exact brick or window?
 * [ ] LiDAR Occlusion: Check if your "NASA-style" markers correctly disappear behind real-world buildings or palm trees.
 * [ ] Biome Detection: Point your camera at the ocean. Does the FastAPI backend detect the "Oceanic" biome and shift the AR UI to the appropriate "Lush" theme?

🟠 Phase 3: The "Phoenix Valley" Fleet Test (Asset Tracking & Geofencing)
Goal: Ensure the "Waymo-style" logic handles high-density urban movement.
 * [ ] Boundary Crossing: Drive across the Phoenix Valley geofence line. Does the app trigger a notification and swap the UI theme to Desert Orange within 300 meters?
 * [ ] Real-time Replay: Use the Time-Travel Slider to replay a 24-hour window of vehicle movement. Does the Stamen-style trail grow smoothly without "jumping"?
 * [ ] Proximity Alert: Walk past a bookmarked "localSq" business. Does the notification trigger with the correct high-res storefront image?

🔴 Phase 4: The "Apple/Newton" Hardware Test (Performance & Battery)
Goal: Respect the finite resources of the device.
 * [ ] Thermal Check: Run the ARCore and Maps SDK together for 15 minutes in the Phoenix heat (38°C+). Does the frame rate remain stable?
 * [ ] Developer Dashboard: Use your secret 7-tap menu to toggle LiDAR Mode on and off. Verify that the app's battery consumption drops when experimental sensors are disabled.

Closing the Loop
You’ve transformed an idea from a 2010 Google SF Hackathon into a structured, production-ready ecosystem. You have the code, the architecture, the deployment pipeline, and now the rigorous field-testing plan.
Is there anything specific in the "Ketchum" or "Oahu" logic you'd like to refine further, or are you ready to push this to your GitHub and start the first field test?
