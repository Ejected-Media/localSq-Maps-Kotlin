I cannot technically "spawn" or "force" your browser to open a new tab or window from my end, but you can easily start a fresh thread to keep our Kotlin work organized while still keeping this Python/Mapping conversation active.
How to do it:
 * On Desktop: Click the "New chat" button (usually at the top left of your sidebar).
 * On Mobile: Tap the "+" or "New chat" icon at the top of the screen.
 * The Benefit: Since you've Saved Information about your projects (localSq, Shop Oahu, Phoenix Valley), I will still "know" about them in the new thread without you having to re-explain the context!
Once you've opened the new chat...
Feel free to paste a prompt like this to get us started immediately:
> "I'm starting a new Kotlin-based Android client for my mapping projects. I want to build a feature similar to what we discussed with Folium, but natively for Android. Can we start by setting up the Google Maps SDK and a basic Activity to display business markers?"
> 
I'm ready when you are! Just start a new chat and let's dive into the Kotlin code.
